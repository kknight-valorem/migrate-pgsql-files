# Migrate PostgreSQL lab files

The four files in this repository are used on your desktop to make it easy to go through the process of migrating PostgreSQL from on-premise to Azure's database for PostgreSQL.

Please read them as the comments are instructive.

Create-Load.ps1     - Powershell to simulate load on a table
Migreate-schema.ps1 - Exports the database schema and imports it into the destination

Git Bash and pgAdmin II are just shortcuts.

Enjoy.
